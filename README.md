# Torrents

Search and download torrents from your favorite bittorrent tracker using **Ruby 1.9**.

Download and get information like:

- Subtitles, english and swedish.
- Movie information (if the torrent is a movie), actors, grade, original title, length, trailers and so on.
- A direct download link to the torrent.
- [IMDB](http://imdb.com) link

## Which trackers are implemented at the moment?

### Open trackers

- [The Pirate Bay](http://thepiratebay.org/)

### Closed trackers

- [TTI](http://tti.nu/)
- [Torrentleech](http://www.torrentleech.org/)

## How to use

### Search for torrents

    >> Torrents.the_pirate_bay.search("chuck").results
    
### List recent torrents

    >> Torrents.the_pirate_bay.results
    
### List recent torrents - with category

    >> Torrents.the_pirate_bay.category(:movies).results
    
### Specify a page

The `page` method can be places anywhere before the `results` method.

It starts counting from `1` and goes up, no matter what is used on the site it self.

    >> Torrents.the_pirate_bay.page(6).results

### Specify some cookies

Some trackers requires cookies to work, even though [The Pirate Bay](http://thepiratebay.org/) is not one of them.

    >> Torrents.the_pirate_bay.cookies(user_id: "123", hash: "c4656002ce46f9b418ce72daccfa5424").results

## What methods to work with

### The results method

As soon as you apply the `results` method on the query it will try to execute your request.
If you for example want to activate the debugger, define some cookies or specify a page, then you might do something like this.
      
      $ Torrents.the_pirate_bay.page(5).debug(true).cookies(:my_cookie => "value").results
      
It will return a list of `Container::Torrent` object if the request was sucessfull, otherwise an empty list.

### The find_by_details method

If you have access to a single details link and want to get some useful data from it, then `find_by_details` might fit you needs.

The method takes the url as an argument and returns a single `Container::Torrent` object.

    $ Torrents.the_pirate_bay.find_by_details("http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6173093/")

# What data to work with

### The Container::Torrent class

The class has some nice accessors that might be useful.

- **title** (String) The title.
- **details** (String) The url to the details page.
- **seeders** (Fixnum) The amount of seeders.
- **dead?** (Boolean) Check to see if the torrent has no seeders. If it has no seeders, then `dead?` will be true.
- **torrent** (String) The url. This should be a direct link to the torrent.
- **id** (Fixnum) An unique id for the torrent. The id is only unique for this specific torrent, not all torrents.
- **tid** (String) The `tid` method, also known as `torrent id` is a *truly* unique identifier for all torrents. It is generated using a [MD5](http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) with the torrent domain and the `id` method as a seed.
- **torrent_id** (String) The same as the `tid` method.
- **imdb** (String) The imdb link for the torrent, if the details view contains one. 
- **imdb_id** (String) The imdb id for the torrent, if the details view contain one. Example: tt0066026.
- **subtitle** ([Undertexter](https://github.com/oleander/Undertexter)) The subtitle for the torrent. Takes one argument, the language for the subtitle. Default is `:english`. Read more about it [here](https://github.com/oleander/Undertexter).
- **movie** ([MovieSearcher](https://github.com/oleander/MovieSearcher)) Read more about the returned object at the [MovieSearcher](https://github.com/oleander/MovieSearcher) project page.

**Note:** The `seeders`, `movie`, `subtitle`, `imdb_id` and `Ã¬mdb` method will do another request to the tracker, which means that it will take a bit longer to load then the other methods.

## What cookies to pass

Here is an example

    $ Torrents.torrentleech.cookies({:member_id => "123", :pass_hash => "value", :PHPSESSID => "value"}).results 
    
All values you pass to `cookies` must be of type string, like in the example above.

- Torrentleech
  - member_id
  - pass_hash
  - PHPSESSID
- TTI
  - hass
  - pass
  - uid

**Note:** The cookies you pass might be browser and IP-adress sensitive. Which means that it might only work in the current browser using the current Internet connection.
  
## Error handling

I decided in the beginning of the project to rescue parse errors during the runtime and instead print them as warnings.

### Why? - Lack of good selectors

The trackers parser, [this](https://github.com/oleander/Torrents/blob/master/lib/torrents/trackers/the_pirate_bay.rb) one for example, isn't always returning the right data. 

Due to the lack of useful CSS selectors on the given tracker. It returns 32 rows, the first and the last containing the header and the footer of the table.
The unwanted results will be thrown away by the [validator](https://github.com/oleander/Torrents/blob/master/lib/torrents/container.rb#L141), but may raise errors during the run time.
The easiest way to solve it was to just isolate the tracker, if it raised an error we return nil.

### Get the error messages

You can read errors in two ways.

Activate the debugger by adding the `debug` method to your query. The errors will be printed as warnings in the console.
  
    $ Torrents.the_pirate_bay.debug(true).results

Request a list of errors using the `errors` method.

    $ Torrents.the_pirate_bay.errors
    >> ["...undefined method `attr' for nil:NilClass>...", "32 torrents where found, 2 where not valid", "..."]

## How do access tracker X

Here is how to access an implemented tracker.
The first static method to apply is the name of the tracker in lower non camel cased letters.

The Pirate Bay becomes `the_pirate_bay`, TTI becomes `tti` and Torrentleech `torrentleech`.

Here is an example.

    $ Torrents.torrentleech.cookies({:my_cookie => "value"}).results 

Take a look at the [tests](https://github.com/oleander/Torrents/tree/master/spec/trackers) for all trackers to get to know more.

## Add you own tracker

I'm about to write a wiki that describes how to add you own site.
Until then, take a look at the parser for [The Pirate Bay](https://github.com/oleander/Torrents/blob/master/lib/torrents/trackers/the_pirate_bay.rb).

All heavy lifting has already been done, so adding another tracker should be quite easy.

I'm using [Nokogiri](http://nokogiri.org/) to parse data from the site, which in most cases means that you don't have to mess with regular expressions.

Don't know Nokogiri? Take a look at [this](http://railscasts.com/episodes/190-screen-scraping-with-nokogiri) awesome screen cast by [Ryan Bates](https://github.com/ryanb). 
    
### The short version

1. Create your own fork of the project.
2. Create and implement a tracker file inside the [tracker directory](https://github.com/oleander/Torrents/tree/master/lib/torrents/trackers).
3. Add a cached version of the tracker [here](https://github.com/oleander/Torrents/tree/master/spec/data). **Note:** Remember to remove sensitive data from the cache like user name and uid.
4. Add tests for it, [here](https://github.com/oleander/Torrents/blob/master/spec/trackers/the_pirate_bay_spec.rb) is a skeleton for the Pirate Bay class to use as a start.
5. Add the tracker to the readme.
6. Do a pull request, if you want to share you implementation with the world.

You don't have to take care about exceptions, `Torrents` does that for you.

## Disclaimer

Before you use `Torrents` make sure you have permission from the tracker in question to use their data.
